## Data

The databases in this repository are organized into projects (e.g., `msa` or `egy`) and then by configuration name. Every subfolder in each project pertains to a specific configuration at some point in time. The subdivision is mainly meant for practical debugging of DBs and is used for that purpose by the modules in the `./camel_morph/debugging` directory. Furthermore, the data kept here is also meant to keep backup snapshots of the databases in case of any problem with the Google Sheets interface.
